# The Next Generation of Wi-Fi Technology Beyond 802.11ax


## Abstract

Wi-Fi technology is continuously innovating to cater to the growing customer demands, driven by the digitalization of everything, in the home as well as in enterprise and hotspot spaces. In this article, we introduce to the wireless community the next generation Wi-Fi, based on IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput (EHT), present the main objectives and timelines of this new 802.11be amendment, thoroughly describe its main candidate features and enhancements, and cover the important issue of coexistence with other wireless technologies. We also provide simulation results to assess the potential throughput gains brought by 802.11be with respect to 802.11ax.





## Objectives and Timeline

* Enabling new MAC and PHY modes of operation capable of supporting a maximum throughput of at least 30 Gb/s, measured at the MAC data service access point — 4x w.r.t. 802.11ax — using carrier frequencies between 1 and 7.125 GHz

* Ensuring backward compatibility and coexistence with legacy 802.11 devices in the 2.4,5, and 6 GHz unlicensed bands 



## Candidate Technical Features
* 320 MHz Bandwidth and More Efficient Utilization of Noncontiguous Spectrum

* Multi-Band/Multi-Channel Aggregation and Operation
* 16 Spatial Streams and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Protocol Enhancements
* Multi-Access Point Coordination
* Enhanced Link Adaptation and Retransmission Protocol
